## LLM Playground: RNNs, LLM Fine-Tuning, and Prompt Engineering

This repo contains three Jupyter notebooks from CIS530: Natural Language Processing course at the University of Pennsylvania, where I played around with different approaches working with language models and text classification tasks.

#### Tools & Libraries
- Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers
- OpenAI API
- scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

### 1. `RNNs.ipynb`
- Implements and trains custom RNNs using PyTorch

### 2. `fine_tuning_llms.ipynb`
- Fine-tunes pretrained BERT model, applying it to down-stream tasks without extra training

### 3. `prompting_llms.ipynb`
- Experiments with few-shot prompting, instruction-tuned models, and chain-of-thought reasoning
